\section{Introduction}
\label{sec: intro}

This project investigates the resilience and efficiency of network communication protocols under varying conditions of redundancy and packet loss. The primary goal is to examine the impact of adjusting the $redundancyFactor$ alongside the $packetDropRate$ on the probability of successful payload decoding at the receiver end. Such an investigation is crucial for understanding and improving the robustness of network systems in environments where data loss and transmission errors are prevalent.

To facilitate a controlled and replicable experiment setup, Docker is employed as the simulation environment. Docker provides a stable and isolated platform where different network configurations and conditions can be emulated with precision. By leveraging Docker containers, we can simulate a network of routers and endpoints, with the ability to finely tune parameters such as the $redundancyFactor$ and $packetDropRates$. This setup allows for a systematic analysis of how these variables influence the effectiveness of data transmission, specifically focusing on the decoding success rate at the network's receiver nodes.

Throughout this project, various scenarios will be constructed to reflect a range of realistic operating conditions. The outcomes will contribute valuable insights into optimal network configurations and strategies, potentially guiding future developments in network design and error correction methodologies. By the conclusion of this experiment, we aim to establish a clearer understanding of the interdependencies between redundancy, packet loss, and payload integrity, ultimately enhancing the reliability of network communications in adverse conditions.
