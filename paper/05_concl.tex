\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}
In conclusion, our study aligns with theoretical expectations regarding the relationship between packet drop rates, redundancy factors, and decoding success rates in unreliable network environments. The findings underscore the importance of minimizing redundancy rates to reduce packet encoding overhead. However, our study encountered limitations due to computational constraints, resulting in simulations limited to a network of 20 routers with a restricted number of hops between each router, which may not fully reflect real-world scenarios. To address these limitations and further refine our understanding, we recommend expanding resources to simulate larger and more complex network topologies. We could also explore other types of packet erasure codes such as Tornado Encoding which might prove to be more robust. By addressing these recommendations, we can contribute to the development of more robust and efficient communication protocols for unreliable network environments.
